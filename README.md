## About this Project
In this repository, we have provided you a REST (REpresentational State Transfer) API project using Rocket web framework.

This project consists of four modules:
1.  `controller`: this module contains handler functions used to receive request and send responses.
    In Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, this is the Controller part.
2.  `model`: this module contains structs that serve as data containers.
    In MVC pattern, this is the Model part.
3.  `service`: this module contains structs with business logic methods.
    In MVC pattern, this is also the Model part.
4.  `repository`: this module contains structs that serve as databases.
    You can use methods of the struct to get list of objects, or operating an object (create, read, update, delete).

This repository provides a Rocket web framework skeleton that you can work with.

As this is an Observer Design Pattern tutorial repository, you need to implement a feature: `Notification`.
This feature will receive notifications of creation, promotion, and deletion of a product, when this receiver instance is subscribed to a certain product type.
The notification will be sent using HTTP POST request, so you need to make the receiver endpoint in this project.

## API Documentations

You can download the Postman Collection JSON here: https://ristek.link/AdvProgWeek7Postman

After you download the Postman Collection, you can try the endpoints inside "BambangShop Receiver" folder.

Postman is an installable client that you can use to test web endpoints using HTTP request.
You can also make automated functional testing scripts for REST API projects using this client.
You can install Postman via this website: https://www.postman.com/downloads/

## How to Run in Development Environment
1.  Set up environment variables first by creating `.env` file.
    Here is the example of `.env` file:
    ```bash
    ROCKET_PORT=8001
    APP_INSTANCE_ROOT_URL=http://localhost:${ROCKET_PORT}
    APP_PUBLISHER_ROOT_URL=http://localhost:8000
    APP_INSTANCE_NAME=Safira Sudrajat
    ```
    Here are the details of each environment variable:
    | variable                | type   | description                                                     |
    |-------------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
    | ROCKET_PORT             | string | Port number that will be listened by this receiver instance.    |
    | APP_INSTANCE_ROOT_URL   | string | URL address where this receiver instance can be accessed.       |
    | APP_PUUBLISHER_ROOT_URL | string | URL address where the publisher instance can be accessed.       |
    | APP_INSTANCE_NAME       | string | Name of this receiver instance, will be shown on notifications. |
2.  Use `cargo run` to run this app.
    (You might want to use `cargo check` if you only need to verify your work without running the app.)
3.  To simulate multiple instances of BambangShop Receiver (as the tutorial mandates you to do so),
    you can open new terminal, then edit `ROCKET_PORT` in `.env` file, then execute another `cargo run`.

    For example, if you want to run 3 (three) instances of BambangShop Receiver at port `8001`, `8002`, and `8003`, you can do these steps:
    -   Edit `ROCKET_PORT` in `.env` to `8001`, then execute `cargo run`.
    -   Open new terminal, edit `ROCKET_PORT` in `.env` to `8002`, then execute `cargo run`.
    -   Open another new terminal, edit `ROCKET_PORT` in `.env` to `8003`, then execute `cargo run`.

## Your Reflections
This is the place for you to write reflections:

### Mandatory (Subscriber) Reflections

#### Reflection Subscriber-1

1. In the Observer design pattern, choosing between an interface (or a trait in Rust) and a single Model struct for the BambangShop application depends on how simple or complex the system needs to be. If every subscriber to updates behaves the same way, then just one Model struct could be enough, which keeps things simple. However, if BambangShop might need to handle different kinds of subscribers later on, each reacting differently, it's better to use a trait. This makes the system more flexible and easier to update because new kinds of subscribers can be added without changing how the main system works. Using a trait helps keep different parts of the system separate, which is a key goal of the Observer pattern. This setup makes it easier to manage and extend the system as it grows.
2. Using a Vec (a type of list) to store unique IDs and URLs in the BambangShop application would mean you have to check every time you add a new one to make sure it's not already there, which can be slow and easy to mess up, especially if the list gets long. Instead, using a DashMap, which is a special type of dictionary in Rust, is a better choice. DashMap automatically prevents adding duplicates and lets you quickly find and update entries. It can also handle many users adding or changing data at the same time without slowing down, which is great for busy apps. So, for managing unique IDs and URLs efficiently and safely, DashMap is the way to go instead of a Vec.
3. In Rust programming, making sure programs are safe to run with multiple threads at the same time is very important. We use DashMap for storing a list of subscribers because it's specifically designed to handle multiple threads safely and efficiently. Although we could use the Singleton pattern, which ensures that only one instance of a class is created, it doesn't automatically handle thread safety. This means that if we used Singleton, we'd need extra steps to make sure it's safe when multiple threads access it, which can make things more complicated. DashMap, on the other hand, is built to be thread-safe right from the start, which makes it a better choice for handling data that multiple threads need to access simultaneously in Rust.
